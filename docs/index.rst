   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to TaskBuster's documentation!
======================================

This is a **Django Project Boilerplate**, based off of Marina Mele's.

Some of the TaskBuster Boilerplate functionalities are:

- **different virtual environments** for developing, testing and production
- **Internationalization** and **localization** to support different languages
- Project structure
- **HTML5 Boilerplate**
- Template inheritence
- Functional **tests**
- robots.txt and humans.txt configures

You can learn how to create this boilerplate yourself, **step by step**,
in the |taskbuster_tutorial|. It's how I learned.
