# Taskbuster Project

Follows the Django project layout (here)[http://www.marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial/internationalization-localization-languages-time-zones].

See `requirements/base.txt` for requirements file to run locally.

You will also need to create `taskbuster/settings/secret_key.py` with
the following contents:

python
```
key = "your_secret_django_key"
```

You will also need `chromedriver` somewhere in your PATH. (Link
